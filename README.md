# 🗳️ Blockchain-Based Voting System (C++)

This project is a **console-based Blockchain Voting System** developed in **C++** to demonstrate how blockchain concepts can be applied to secure electronic voting.

The system compares a **normal voting approach** with a **blockchain-enhanced voting mechanism**, highlighting improvements in **security, transparency, and data integrity**.

## 🚀 Features

- Voter registration using unique voter IDs  
- Queue-based vote processing  
- Multiple polling stations support  
- Secure vote storage using blockchain  
- SHA-based hashing for block integrity  
- Previous hash linking for tamper detection  
- Admin panel & election result viewing  
- Blockchain validation to ensure data integrity

## 🔐 Blockchain Implementation

Each vote is stored inside a block containing:
- Voter ID  
- Selected candidate  
- Timestamp  
- Current hash  
- Previous block hash  

This ensures that once a vote is recorded, it **cannot be altered without breaking the entire chain**.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- C++  
- STL (Vectors, Queues, Maps)  
- Hashing (Blockchain simulation)  
- Console-based UI

## 📸 Sample Output

Screenshots demonstrating voter registration, vote casting, and blockchain ledger are included in the `screenshots/` folder.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding blockchain fundamentals  
- Secure data handling  
- Practical use of data structures  
- Real-world application of C++ OOP concepts
